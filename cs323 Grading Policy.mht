<H2>Re-grading Policy [<FONT color=3D#ff0000>very =
important!]</FONT></H2>
<P>After the grades for a quiz or a MP or a exam is available on the <A=20
href=3D"https://gradebook.cso.uiuc.edu/SWA">gradebook</A>, students have =
<FONT=20
color=3D#ff0000>1 week</FONT> to request for re-grading of this =
quiz/MP/exam. Once=20
the 1 week re-grading period passes, students can <FONT=20
color=3D#ff0000>never</FONT> ask for re-grading of this =
quiz/MP/exam.</P>
<H2>Cheating Policy</H2>Your work in this class <B>must</B> be your own. =
You may=20
discuss, in broad terms, such things as strategies for completing =
machine=20
problems. Be aware that, as a general rule, <FONT =
color=3D#ff0000>pseudo-code is=20
not "broad terms"</FONT>. <FONT color=3D#ff0000>The programs and exams =
you hand=20
in, however, must contain only your own work</FONT>. Your program will =
be=20
checked against other programs in the class for similarities. If you =
have any=20
questions about this policy, please talk to the staff. In the past, we =
have=20
caught students cheating by copying programs from other students without =
their=20
knowledge. To avoid having your work copied without your knowledge, =
refrain from=20
leaving source code prints lying around the lab, protect your files, =
don't give=20
your passwords to anyone, and enter your passwords in a way that cannot =
be seen=20
by others. Do not leave a login session active on an unattended =
workstation. Use=20
xlock in the sparc lab if you must leave briefly, or use some similar =
measure=20
(or log out!) in other labs; remember that it's a violation of the sparc =
lab=20
policy (and probably the other lab policies) to leave your workstation=20
unattended for any extended period of time. Report any suspicious =
behavior to=20
the lab sitters or the TAs.=20
<H2>Late Policy</H2>Assignments must be handed in by the deadline, or as =
soon=20
after it as possible. <FONT color=3D#ff0000>Assignments will be graded =
down 2% for=20
each hour they are late. </FONT>
<H2>Exams</H2>The final exam will be on May 10th, Saturday, 8:00-11:00 =
am. The=20
classroom for the final exam will be announced.&nbsp; Please, attempt to =

determine and discuss potential exam conflicts with the staff as soon as =

possible. In addition, there will be two in-class midterm exams.=20
<H2>Final Grades</H2>
<P>Final grades are determined based on the distribution of the final =
score (a=20
weighted sum of the exams, MPs and quizzes). </P></DD></BODY></HTML>
